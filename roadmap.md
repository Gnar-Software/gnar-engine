# Gnar Engine - Roadmap

### Overview

In this roadmap, we outline our vision and planned features for Gnar Engine. Our goal is to create a robust, scalable, and user-friendly framework for building modern web applications. Although all facets will be continually improved and supported, our primary focus will be on the following key phases:

Open Source
    Phase 1 - Gnar Engine Framework (open source): Service Core & CLI

Proprietary
    Phase 2 - Gnar Cloud: Cost effective and simplified deployments (think Vercel for Gnar Engine Microservices)
    Phase 3 - Gnar Agents: Secure, specialised AI agents that can interact with your services. Deployed and managed through Gnar Cloud, private for your services.
    Phase 4 - Gnar Copilot: Code generation assistant for developers to help build, maintain and extend Gnar Engine services and applications.
    Phase 5 - Gnar Engine Market Place: A marketplace for developers to build and sell pre-built Gnar Engine services, modules and complete  applications for use and extension.
